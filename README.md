A basic Run'N Jump game developed using the RayLib library and C++.

To run the game, basically run the .exe file. The game is over if the player touches an orb and must be shutdown and ran again to play. 
Use SPACE to jump over the obstacles.

Created by following the GameDev.tv course named "C++ Fundementals: Game Programming For Beginners".
